  <p>The Episcopal Church in MN's Youth Music Camp (EYMC) has grown to its capacity. 
  This summer in July  we will begin Episcopal Youth Quest Camp (EYQC) designed for 6th - 8th grade with a peer ministry track for 9th - 12th grade along with a leadership development team for 
  post high school young adults ages 18 - 22. 
  The camp is staffed by experienced adult volunteers with a focus on outdoor activities, the faith journey, and leadership. 
  Our days begin with worship and exploration and our evenings close with music, sharing, and community around the campfire. 
  Through fun, friendship, and formative outdoor experiences your campers discover their own identity as God's beloved.
